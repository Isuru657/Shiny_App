# An app to perform basic data analysis 

The app is designed to help employees carry out basic data analysis without the company having to employ a data analyst. The user has to upload a .csv file and select variables that they are interested in. The app was made for an online travel advisor so the app analyzes data using two main KPIs: travel frequency and online bookings revenue.
